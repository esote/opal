OPAL's Playable Almost Indefectibly. OPAL is a rogue-like dungeon crawler. Get
flag info using ./opal.out -h.

Damage is calculated as the sum of dice rolls for the player's base damage and
all equipped items.

The monster and object parsing is implemented in Yacc and (F)Lex, so compilation
requires them.

Requires support for C++17 and POSIX threads.
