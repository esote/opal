NAME
	opal - a rogue-like dungeon crawler

SYNOPSIS
	opal [-ls] [-n count] [-o count] [-z seed]

DESCRIPTION
	opal is a rogue-like dungeon crawler. You are the playable character,
	denoted by the symbol @. The goal is to kill the boss NPC. As a player
	you can pick up objects from the floor and wear them to increase your
	attributes.

	Damage is calculated as the sum of dice rolls for the player's base
	damage and all equipped items.

	Options available:
	-l	load dungeon
	-s	save dungeon
	-n	custom count of NPCs per floor
	-o	custom count of objects per floor
	-z	a string or integer to initialize the RNG subsystem

	opal expects NPC and object description files. Examples should have been
	included with your copy.

	OPAL is a recursive acronym for "OPAL's Playable Almost Indefectibly."
