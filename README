OPAL's Playable Almost Indefectibly. OPAL is a rogue-like dungeon crawler.

OPAL expects NPC and object description files at $HOME/.opal/npc_desc and
$HOME/.opal/obj_desc respectively. Example files have been provided.

Damage is calculated as the sum of dice rolls for the player's base damage and
all equipped items.

The NPC and object parsing is implemented in Yacc and (F)Lex, so compilation
requires them.

Requires support for C++17 and POSIX threads.
